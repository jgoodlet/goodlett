## Me

I am a software engineer and _sometimes_ carpenter. I approach my work with integrity, honesty, curiosity, and an intense desire to build meaningful things. Collaborative environments are where I thrive as I find both mentoring to and learning from others exceptionally empowering.

With over two decades in software engineering, I bring a strong track record of building secure, scalable systems and streamlining complex processes. I am primarily a Python developer with a focus on creating high-performance APIs and backend systems, though I'm currently exploring AI/ML and front-end tooling.
